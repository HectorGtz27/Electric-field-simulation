# Simulation of an electric field between two parallel charges 

Using Matlab, we were able to simulate a non-uniform electric field, which referred to as DIOELECTROPHORESIS, can detect red blood cells that are infected, due to their different electrical properties (they have more charge). Technology plays a very important role in the area of medicine, finding ways more efficient in diagnosing diseases and thus be able to prevent deaths.
